# Q Learning Agent Playing FrozenLake-v1-4x4-no_slippery
This is a trained model of a Q Learning agent playing FrozenLake.

Using Google Colab, I trained a Q Learning agent that learns to go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G) by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).
